"can you write a c code?
clear the output","Hi! ðŸ˜Š 

Let's break down your questions:

**1. Semester Fee:**  The semester fee for the CSE program at USTC is **57,000 BDT.**

**2. Dean of the University:** The Dean of FSET (Faculty of Science and Technology) is **Dr. Hadaayet Ullah.** His email is `hadaate@ustc.ac.bd`. 

**3. C Code Example:**  
 ```c
 #include <stdio.h>

 int main() {
     printf(""Hello, World!\n"");
     return 0;
 }
 ```

 **Explanation:**

* **#include <stdio.h>**: This line incorporates the standard input/output library which provides tools for working with text and outputting data to the console (e.g., printing). 
* **int main() { ... }**:  This is the main function, the starting point of every C program. The code inside this block will be executed.
* **printf(""Hello, World!\n"");**: This line prints ""Hello, World!"" to the console followed by a newline character (`\n`).
* **return 0;**: This indicates that the program has executed successfully.

Let me know if you'd like help understanding any part of this code! 


**Additional Notes:**  I'm still under development, but I can do a lot to help with questions about USTC and coding in general. ðŸ˜„

"can you write a c code?
clear the output","Let's address each of your questions: 

**1. Semester Fee:** The semester fee for the CSE program at USTC is **57,000 BDT.** 


**2. Dean of the University:**  The current Dean of FSET (Faculty of Science and Technology) is **Dr. Hadaayet Ullah**.  His email is **hadaate@ustc.ac.bd**


**3. C Code Example**

```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() {
    printf(""Hello, world!\n""); // This prints ""Hello, world!"" to the console
    return 0;  
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **#include <stdio.h>:** This line includes a standard input/output library that provides functions for handling input and output operations, like printing to the screen (`printf`).
* **int main():**  This is the `main` function, which is the entry point of every C program.  The code within this block is executed when the program runs.
* **printf(""Hello, world!\n"");:** This line uses `printf` to print the text ""Hello, world!"" followed by a newline character (`\n`) to move the cursor to the next line on the screen. 
* **return 0;**: This indicates that the program executed successfully.  A return value of 0 from `main()` is a signal that there were no errors during execution.

**To run this code:**

1. Save it as a `.c` file (e.g., `hello_world.c`).
2. Compile it using a C compiler like GCC: `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`
3. Run the compiled executable: `./hello_world`



**How to Get Help with Code:**

* **Ask me for specific coding help!**: Feel free to ask for help with more complex code examples, error-checking, algorithms, or general C concepts.
